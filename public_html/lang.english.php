She is involved in implanting vegan daily meals and zero-waste cafeterias at her university. As the environmental impact of animal agriculture is getting more and more important and as the tremendous amount of waste and disposable goods keeps growing in landfills, changing our eating habits is necessary. Alicia believes that major changes must be done collectively and hopes that Laval University will become an example for other schools in terms of sustainable food services.",

"news_img_2_paragraph" => "Since the beginning of my university studies in Chemical Engineering, I have gained a lot of knowledge. As a
fourth-year student, I now possess a wealth of theoretical and practical knowledge. The theoretical knowledge
has mostly been developed on the seats of Université Laval. The practical knowledge was acquired during my
few practical training internships in industry. Blending this knowledge together is possible in the Chem-E-Car
Université Laval Project, a highly innovative student project that exists thanks to the creativity of its members.
Indeed, by applying principles of chemical engineering, we are trying to meet some of the challenges of today's
society in the fields of the environment by designing a small car that respects the principles of sustainable
development. I am however not alone in this project. We are a team of 10 students who are committed to the
project. Our goal is to present the concepts that we experiment with during some US congresses and during the
World Congress of Chemical Engineering, in October of 2017. As a result, the full amount of the scolarship will
be given to the team for the continuation of the project.
I wanted to study at Université Laval because of the existence of the Chem-E-Car project. I thought that it had a
lot of potential, but that it did not take advantage of the concepts to ensure its survival. Thanks to my perspective,
I managed to give a new direction to the project by including sustainable development in the expression of our
objectives. This scholarship also confirms that I can take part in activities where I engage socially during my
university studies.",
